Please note that in the "Fixed bugs" sections, the bugs are not just related to the previous version, most of the time they also affect other old releases.


<h1>April 3, 2012<br>
v. 4.4<br></h1><hr size="1">

<b>New features and feature changes</b><br/><br/>

DaDaBIK can now officially handle and create front-end for views, in addition to front-end for normal tables. This can help in creating more flexible database applications.<br><br>

It is now possible to avoid the display of the NULL column in the insert/edit form. A parameter $null_checkbox is now available in config.php. Note that, if the record you are editing contains a NULL value for one or more fields, the NULL checkboxes are displayed anyway, even if $null_checkbox is set to 0.<br><br>

The DaDaBIK end-user interface is now available in Russian.<br><br>

Oracle and MS SQL Server are not officially supported anymore.<br><br>

German, Dutch and French translations are now complete.<br><br>



<b>Fixed bugs</b><br><br>

Some special characters were not correctly escaped in some situations, this chould lead to errors and/or insert/update of wrong data in the database.<br><br>

DaDaBIK, with SQLite, didn't produce error messages if an SQL query failed. For example, an insert query which violated a constrain, was reported as "Record correctly inserted." even if the record was not inserted. Fixed.<br/><br/>

DaDaBIK produced a "Fatal error: Cannot re-assign auto-global variable _POST" if used together with PHP 4.4. Fixed.<br/><br/>

DaDaBIK produced an error during installation with PostgreSQL >= 9.1. Fixed. <br/><br/>

If all the fields of an edit form were required but one or more fields were NULL in the database, the corresponding NULL checkbox were displayed but the column label "NULL" were not. Fixed, the column label is now displayed.<br><br>

A bug prevented to work correctly with date type field and SQLite. Fixed. Thanks to Triton for having reported it (<a href="http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?1,14771">http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?1,14771</a>).<br/><br/>

If, for a date field, the value of the month was set to other than [1-12] OR the value of the day was set to other than [1-31] OR the value of the year was set to other than [$start_year-$end_year] DaDaBIK will displayed in the edit view, for the relative field, the first default value available in the listbox. For example if a date field was set 1940-00-00 in the database, DaDaBIK will display, in its default configuration, 1968-01-01 and updated the date to 1968-01-01 if the record is saved. Fixed. Now DaDaBIK produce an error message if a date value is not representable with the day-month-year listboxes.<br><br>

If, for a select_single field, the user selected "other" and didn't specify a custom value during insert/update, the value "......" was inserted. Fixed, now a "required field" error message is displayed. <br><br>

If, after a insert/update operation, the form was displayed again to the user because of an error (e.g. a required field was not filled) and the value of a date field was set to NULL, some undefined variable messages were displayed. Fixed.<br><br>

If, for a select_single field, the user selected "other" and specify a custom value during insert, that new value was not included as additional option. Fixed.<br><br>

<b>Other changes</b><br/><br/>

A new section, "Unexpected behaviors" has been added to the documentation. It's a list of behaviors which the average user doesn't expect from DaDaBIK but that probably can't be considered real bugs. An important point discussed here is about the value actually inserted in the database during an insert/update, if the value typed in the form is not part of the domain specified during table creation.<br><br>

The "Known bugs and limitations" section of the documentation has been updated, highlighting two bugs, one related to search operations and the other related to some characters which, for some languages, are incorrectly displayed.


<br/>

<h1>February 14, 2012<br>
v. 4.4 beta<br></h1><hr size="1">

<b>Fixed bugs</b><br><br>

The authentication didn't work correctly and prevent users to log-in if the DBMS chosen was SQLite. FIXED.<br/><br/>

The date field type didn't work properly during insert/update/search and produced a "Notice: Undefined property" message. FIXED.<br/><br/>

Master/details view didn't work correctly with SQLite and produced a "Call to undefined method PDOStatement::MoveFirst()" message. FIXED.<br/><br/>

When a new item was inserted in a master-details view, the default "parent" item wasn't selected if the field name of the parent table and the (fk) field name of the items table were different. FIXED.<br/><br/>

<b>Other changes</b><br/><br/>
The "Known bugs and limitations" section of the documentation has been updated, highlighting a new date-field related bug; the lack of a locking mechanism during records editing has also been highlighted in the documentation, since the current behaviour could lead to unexpected results and data loss.

<br/>

<h1>February 2, 2011<br>
v. 4.4 alpha<br></h1><hr size="1">

<b>New features and feature changes</b><br/><br/>
DaDaBIK now supports <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a><br/><br/>

A new content type "timestamp" is available. The corresponding field must contain an integer, which is displayed as a date and time according to the format chosen with the paramenter $date_format.<br/><br/>

magic_quotes_sybase = on in php.ini is no longer required for Oracle and MS SQL Server<br/><br/>

The documentation is now more clear about the master/details view.<br/><br/>

A new parameter, $timezone, allows to set the timezone.<br/><br/>

The sql logging feature is not available anymore.<br/><br/>

<b>Fixed bugs</b><br><br>

The authentication didn't work if DaDaBIK was installed in the root of a Website (e.g. www.mysite.com and not www.mysite.com/dadabik).<br/><br/>

DaDaBIK produced an error about date_default_timezone_set if the PHP version was < 5.1.<br/>


<h1>December 8, 2010<br>
v. 4.3 final<br></h1><hr size="1">

<b>Fixed bugs and feature changes<br><br></b>
The TinyMCE version used to implement the rich_editor is now the 3.3.9.2 . This can fix security problems and other issues that the old TinyMCE version used could cause.
<br><br>

Some MAC OS not needed files were included in the DaDaBIK release. Fixed (thanks Tobias S. for pointing out).<br><br>

On Windows Vista (and maybe on other Operating Systems), some warnings about encoding were displayed by the system during the extraction of the zip release file. Fixed (thanks Tobias S. for pointing out).<br><br>

DaDaBIK showed a "delete all" link for an items table even if the delete operation was disabled for that table. The "delete all" operation, however, wasn't executed. Fixed.<br><br>

After a "delete all" operation performed on a master/details view, DaDaBIK showed the results view of the details table instead of coming back to the master/details view. Fixed.<br><br>

DaDaBIK now shows a table alias near to the "insert item" link.<br><br>

Minor change to the English interface<br><br>

A small banner is now showed in the homepage of the admin interface.<br><br>

The changelog didn't contain the changes for DaDaBIK 4.3 beta. Fixed.

<br>


<h1>November 28, 2010<br>
v. 4.3 beta RC2 (release candidate 2)<br></h1><hr size="1">

<b>New features, fixed bugs and feature changes<br><br></b>
DaDaBIK, with some PHP versions and error reporting settings, produced some "Deprecated" and "Strict Standard" warnings. This was due to the ADOdb version used, which was too old. DaDaBIK now uses the last ADOdb version for PHP5 and automatically load the last PHP4 compatible ADOdb library if you are still using PHP4. This can also fix security problems and other issues that the old ADOdb version used could cause.
<br><br>

The single-donation button of the admin section didn't work.<br><br>

A lot of not strictly-needed files has been removed from the official release, which is now lighter.<br><br>

It is now possible to to send feedback on DaDaBIK to hotscripts.com directly from the admin section.<br><br>

The documentation didn't explain how to upgrade to 4.3 rc1. Fixed.
<br>

<h1>November 23, 2010<br>
v. 4.3 beta RC1 (release candidate 1)<br></h1><hr size="1">

<b>New features and feature changes<br><br></b>DaDaBIK has a new administration section: new look, some improvements in the interface, in-line help for the interface configurator, possibility to send feedback, to donate and to buy email/phone commercial support. The configuration file has been improved in clarity too.<br><br>It is now possible to choose if a table can appear in the table list menu.<br><br>The "home" button, which had been deleted, is now available again.<br><br>If a table is an "items table" in a master-details view, the insert/search/show all/last search results top buttons are not anymore displayed,<br><br>The documentation has been completely revised, clarifying some aspects when needed and highlighting some new known bugs/limitations.<br><br>Minor GUI enanchements.<br><br><b><br>Fixed bugs</b><br><br>DaDaBIK 4.3 beta3 in a case-sensitive environment didn't include the htmLawed library because of a mistake in the case of a letter. This leave DaDaBIK exposed to the security risk that version 4.3 beta3 was supposed to fix (see 4.3 beta 3 changelog's entry for details). A "Warning: include(./include/htmlawed/htmlawed.php) : failed to open stream" warning messase could also be produced. Thanks to <a href="http://www.dadabik.org/forum/profile.php?1,65597">Kaiya</a> for pointing this out.<br><br>
With PHP &lt; 4.1.0 and DaDaBIK 4.3 beta, beta2 or beta3 there could be
problems with the escaping procedure, this could lead to various
problems (even security problems).<br><br>The URL validation didn't work as expected.<br><br>The enable/disable features control didn't work as expected.<br><br>If the first table present in the table list menu was empty (no records), DaDaBIK didn't show the table list menu.<br><br>When $enable_browse_authorization was enabled, using the previous-next links DaDaBIK tried to show also non-authorized records; the records details weren't showed but a message "You don't have the authorization to view this record." was displayed.<br><br>DaDaBIK, if a table was used as "items" table, didn't correctly take into consideration the permissions (insert, edit, details, delete) set in order to display the corresponding controls.<br><br>When a record is deleted, now also the files linked to the record are deleted. Is it possible to control this behaviour changing the new config parameters delete_files_when_delete_record.<br>

<h1>November 15, 2010<br>
v. 4.3 beta3</h1><hr size="1">

<b>Fixed bugs and changes</b><br><br>

If a DaDaBIK application was configured to use at least one html content type field or one rich_editor field type field, a malicious user who had access to the application could insert in the field some arbitrary javascript code, which was then executed by other users just by using the application.
Among other problems, this could lead to XSS attack (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting</a>), which in turn could allow an unauthorized access to the application (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking</a>) and, if the Internet browser of the user contained security holes, even the execution of arbitrary code in the client machine. The problem is now fixed applying a filter provided by the htmLawed library (<a href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed">http://www.bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed</a>) when the output is displayed. You must however keep in mind that, as the documentation states (<a href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed/htmLawed_README.htm#s2.8">http://www.bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed/htmLawed_README.htm#s2.8</a>), there are some minor cases in which htmLawed can fail.<br><br>

Since htmLawed requires at least PHP version 4.3, even the PHP minimum version requirements of DaDaBIK have changed from 4.05 to 4.3.

<h1>November 11, 2010<br>
v. 4.3 beta2</h1><hr size="1">

<b>Fixed bugs</b><br><br>

If in a DaDaBIK application the insert or edit feature was enabled (at least for one table) and a select_single field type was used (at least once, even in another table), a malicious user who had access to the application could in many cases insert in a listbox some arbitrary javascript code, which was then executed by other users just by using the application.
Among other problems, this could lead to XSS attack (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting</a>), which in turn could allow an unauthorized access to the application (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking</a>) and, if the Internet browser of the user contained security holes, even the execution of arbitrary code in the client machine. This problem have been fixed in version 4.3 beta2.<br>The problems described above can occur even when the insert or edit feature was enabled (at least for one table) and the HTML content type is used; at the moment there isn't a patch for this second scenario, the HTML content type should be used carefully, as highlighted in the upgraded documentation.<br><br>


DaDaBIK didn't show the default edit, delete and delete icons.

DaDaBIK could display a deprecated warning related to eregi if used together with PHP &gt;= 5.3<br><br>

The upgrade file upgrade_4.3.php was not adodb-compatible and therefore probably didn't work with all the DBMS supported.

v. 4.1 release candidate 2</h1><hr size="1">
<b>Fixed bugs</b><br><br>

The "refresh installation" admin operation didn't work correctly and could lead to an interface configurator settings loss. Please note that this bug can appear even on a DaDaBIK version &gt;= 4.1 rc2 if the installation is the result of an upgrade from a version &lt; 4.1 rc2; the bug is considered fixed only for tables installed (DaDaBIK installation from scratch or single table installation from the admin interface) using a DaDaBIK version &gt;= 4.1 rc2.<br><br>

DaDaBIK in some cases produced an "[08] Error: during query execution." error message if the user clicked on the previous or next record links.<br><br>

v. 4.1 release candidate 1</h1><hr size="1">
<b>Fixed bugs</b><br><br>

If a table was empty and the user selected it, the tables listbox disappeared so it was impossible to choose another table.<br><br>

The upgrade script upgrade_4.1.php had the name of one of the DaDaBIK tables hard-coded; this could lead to problems during the upgrade process if the $table_list_name (confgi.php) variable value was not "dadabik_table_list".<br><br>

The upgrade script upgrade_4.1.php didn't work correctly on Oracle.<br><br>

Portuguese language  is now complete.<br><br>

Croatian language is now complete.<br><br>

Swedish language was not present in the documentation languages list.

<h1>October 24, 2006<br>
v. 4.1 beta</h1><hr size="1">
<b>New features and feature changes</b><br><br>

Better form errors handling: if an error occurs when the user fills a form (e.g. an URL format is not correct), DaDaBIK will display again the form and point out the type of error.<br><br>

DaDaBIK now remembers the last search executed on a table, even if you change table.<br><br>

It is now possible to choose the number of result records displayed per page on the fly. DaDaBIK also saves the number choosed on a per-table base.<br><br>

It is now possible to set an alias for each table, the alias is used in the table listbox instead of the table name.<br><br>

DaDaBIK now uses tinymce 2.0.7 (<a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com">http://tinymce.moxiecode.com</a>) to implement the rich_editor field type instead of htmlarea. This leads to FireFox compatibily.<br><br>

DaDaBIK now highlights a results table row when the mouse pointer is over it. It also highlights a results table row when the user click on it, until the user click it again. You can disable this feature by using the new config.php parameter $enable_row_highlighting.<br><br>

On Oracle, from the record results view, several "Undefined index" notices were displayed, it was not possible to correctly enter the detail and the edit form of the records and the delete record function didn't work.<br><br>

On Oracle 10, DaDaBIK tried to use the recycle bin tables too.<br><br>

The documentation has been revisited.<br><br>

In the install.php and header_admin.php scripts the name of the file index.php was hard-coded, instead of varying according to the $dadabik_main_file config variable.<br><br>

<b>New features</b><br><br>
Added two known bugs to the documentation, in particular it has been highlighted a possible security problem of the DaDaBIK authentication model.<br><br>


<h1>March 31, 2005<br>
v. 3.2 beta</h1><hr size="1">
<b>Fixed bugs</b><br><br>

DaDaBIK produced a "[08] Error: during query execution" error message in the details view if, for a field, the primary key field name of the main table was the same of the primary key field name of the linked table.<br><br>

All the "Undefined variable" error messages have been fixed, DaDaBIK can now works correctly with error_reporting = E_ALL.<br><br>

DaDaBIK lost the "Other choices allowed?" option information after a "Refresh installation" procedure (administration interface).<br><br>

DaDaBIK produced a "[08] Error: during query execution" error message if, during an insert or update, a new option was added to a select_single field with no linked fields and at least one of the preexisting options contained a character to be escaped (e.g. ').<br><br>

DaDaBIK produced a "[08] Error: during query execution" error message if, during an insert or update, there was at least one select_single field with linked fields, $enable_authentication and $enable_browse_authorization were enabled, the table contains an ID_user field and the linked table doesn't contain any ID_user fields with the same field name.<br><br>

An Italian sentence was not correct.<br><br>

DaDaBIK produced a parse error message if the German language was used<br>(<a href="http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=3432&amp;t=3432">http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=3432&amp;t=3432</a>).<br><br>

In the footer page the name of the file index.php was hard-coded, instead of varying according to the $dadabik_main_file config variable.<br>
(<a href="http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?f=2&amp;i=371&amp;t=371">http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?f=2&amp;i=371&amp;t=371</a>).<br><br>

Config variable $always_add_blank_option_search didn't work correctly, the variable is not used any more and now DaDaBIK always add a blank option to the select_single fields.<br><br>

<b>New features and feature changes</b><br><br>

The authentication code has been in part rewritten:
<ul>
	<li>The class simpleLogin (<a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/1492.html">http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/1492.html</a>) is not used any more
	</li><li>DaDaBIK stores now user information in the database and passwords are now md5 encrypted

	</li><li>You can use DaDaBIK itself in order to add and delete users, show and modify users information
	</li><li>The admin pages (admin.php, install.php) are not login-protected any more, you have to provide your own protection
	</li><li>A select_single field with linked fields now shows a listbox with all the corresponding linked table records, regardless of the ownership.
</li></ul>

Six new languages are available: Croatian, Polish, Catalan, Estonian, Rumanian, Portuguese.<br><br>

A "top" link has been added to the HTML footer.<br><br>

The documentation has been updated and improved, in particular a FAQ section is now available.<br><br>

<h1>July 19, 2004<br>
v. 3.1 beta</h1><hr size="1">
<b>Fixed bugs</b><br><br>

DaDaBIK produced a "[08] Error: during query execution" when a linked table was referenced more than once in the same table.<br><br>

DaDaBIK didn't display correct result values when the same field name appears both in a table and in a linked table as linked field or in two linked tables as linked field.<br><br>


<b>New features</b><br><br>
DaDaBIK has now a rewritten engine that perform the select query using joins and aliases (this fixes the bug above)<br><br>

A basic authorization model is available, it is now possible to allow a user to delete only his own records, modify only his own records, view only his own records. For the authentication the class simpleLogin (<a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/1492.html">http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/1492.html</a>) has been (probably temporary) used, but it is possible to easily customize the authentication.<br><br>

A new field type is available: <i>rich_editor</i>; it is a rich text editor (htmlArea 2.03 by interactivetools.com <a href="http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/">http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/</a>) that allows to easily insert/modify HTML content<br><br>

A new content type is available: <i>html</i>, DaDaBIK doesn't perform a conversion from special characters to HTML entities with <i>htmlspecialchars</i> for the fields having this content type<br><br>

DaDaBIK starts now displaying the records of the first table available, without showing the home page menu. All the application (except from the administration area) uses now just one file index.php, easily renameable to embed it in a pre-existent Web site.<br><br>

An upgrade script is now available, it is possible to upgrade from 3.0 beta or 3.0 to 3.1 beta without loosing the interface configurator settings.<br><br>

A new parameter $enable_delete_all_feature allows to enable/disable the <i>delete all</i> feature<br><br>


<h1>May 25, 2004<br>
v. 3.0</h1><hr size="1">
<b>Fixed bugs</b><br><br>

DaDaBIK produced a "[08] Error: during query execution" error when a table name contained blank spaces
(<a href="http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=2136&amp;t=2136">http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=2136&amp;t=2136</a>).<br><br>

DaDaBIK produced a "[08] Error: during query execution" error when the MySQL version was prior to 3.23.06.<br><br>

DaDaBIK produced a "[08] Error: during query execution" error when a field has some linked fields associated and the primary key field is not numeric
(<a href="http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=2365&amp;t=2365">http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=2365&amp;t=2365</a>).<br><br>

DaDaBIK produced a "Call to undefined function: ob_clean()...." fatal error if the export to CSV feature was enabled and the PHP version was &lt; 4.2.0 (<a href="http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=2329&amp;t=2209">http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=2329&amp;t=2209</a>); the export to CSV now works also with PHP version prior to 4.2.0.<br><br>

DaDaBIK produced a parse error when the Italian language was used.<br><br>

Fixed some translations and added a missing sentence in the Italian language file.<br><br>

The word "home" in the bottom links menu is now available in each language file and no more hard-coded.<br><br>

DaDaBIK produced a "Undefined variable: mail_feature....." notice.<br><br>
<b>New features</b><br><br>
A new parameter $word_wrap_fix_width allows to choose if $word_wrap_col determines also the width of the column in the results table or not.<br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>
The following two bugs have been discovered during the beta testing:<br><br>

DaDaBIK produces a "[08] Error: during query execution" when a linked table is referenced more than once in the same table (<a href="http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=2374&amp;t=2374">http://www.dadabik.org/forum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=2374&amp;t=2374</a>).<br><br>

DaDaBIK doesn't display correct result values when the same field name appears both in a table and in a linked table as linked field or in two linked tables as linked field.<br><br>

These bugs will be fixed in the version 3.1 because they require to partially rewrite the engine that produce the SELECT statement.

<h1>March 10, 2004<br>
v. 3.0 Beta</h1><hr size="1">
All the code has been revisited and in some case rewritten in order to increase efficiency and clarity.<br>
<br>
<b>New features and feature changes</b><br>
<br>
The primary-foreign key feature is now complete: it is possible to link a field of a table (foreign key) to a number of fields of another table (containing the primary key). The produced HTML select menu will have the linked field values as "options" and the primary key values as "values". This allow to use a normalized db design.<br>

<br>
Edit, delete and details buttons are now normal links (not HTML forms as before) and pass all the necessary values via GET, so it is now possible to call the detail page of a record from its own unique URL.<br>
<br>
Documentation, administration interface and config.php file are now more clear and complete than before.<br>
<br>
Each DaDaBIK error message has now a code, in order to identify it better, especially during bug reports.<br>
<br>
DaDaBIK messages are now displayed everywhere needed and are more clean than before.<br>
<br>
It is now possible to disable the displaying of the search/insert/update buttons at the top of the form through config.php.<br>

<br>
The function that validate URLs now support port numbers, https protocol and four letters primary domain name (e.g. .info).<br>
<br>

<br>
DaDaBIK now use the $_GET $_POST $_FILES....variables introduced in PHP 4.1.0<br>
<br>
The change table select menu is now an auto-submit one (it is possible to disable this feature through config.php, however).<br>
<br>
The update statements now use "LIMIT 1" to ensure that only one record is updated, but only if the MySQL version is &gt;= 3.23.<br>
<br>
A blank first option is always added to select_single fields when a search form is produced (it is possible to disable this feature through config.php, however).<br>
<br>
The select_multiple field types are not handled any more, at least for the moment.<br>
<br>
Linking tables contained in different databases isn't handled any more.<br>
<br>
DaDaBIK no more display automatically a column sign (":") after each label.<br>
<br>

<br>
DaDaBIK produced an error when tried to display the possible duplicates during an insert operation if some field names need back quotes.<br>
<br>
DaDaBIK produced an error when the user clicked on a result page link and the current "order by" field needed to be url encoded.<br>
<br>

<br>
Field order changer didn't work properly: field positions weren't shifted correctly.<br>
<br>
DaDaBIK check the similarity of records during and insert operation by using a case sensitive function, this was not correct.<br>
<br>
DaDaBIK failed to handle properly the upload when the uploaded file name contained a single quote.<br>
<br>
DaDaBIK displayed a broken image link if a record containing an image_file field had no images associated. This happened only with MS IE as a browser.<br>
<br>
Fixed the bug that produced a "Warning:  stat failed...." message sometimes during an upload.<br>
<br>
DaDaBIK lost the value associated with the "Other choices allowed" parameter when, from the administration interface, you clicked on "Refresh internal table".<br>
<br>
Upload failed when two files with the same name were uploaded in the same time.<br>
<br>
Word wrap feature now works also with email and url fields.<br>
<br>
Back quotes were used only if the MySQL version was &gt; 3.23.6, even if also MySQL 3.23.6 supports them, now are used if the MySQL version is &gt;= 3.23.6 <br>

<br>
<h1>March 11, 2003<br>
v. 2.2.1</h1><hr size="1">

<b>Fixed bugs</b><br>
<br>
When a record containing an image_file or generic_file field was updated without uploading a new file, the record loosed the link with the old file; this bug has been fixed.<br>
<br>
When a user perform a search in a table containing an image_file or generic_file field the "browse" button was displayed by the browser for those fields, this behavior makes no sense; this bug has been fixed.<br>
<br>
The field names of the where clause in the update statements were not back quoted, consequently the update failed if the name of the primary key field needed to be escaped (e.g. a reserved word), this bug has been fixed.<br>
<br>
The dutch version of DaDaBIK produced a parse error, this bug has been fixed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>New features</b><br>
It is now possible to choose if you want to delete (both in the database and phisically) a previously uploaded file.<br>
<br>
When two or more files with the same name are uploaded, a new name is assigned automatically (e.g. my_file.txt become my_file_2.txt if my_file.txt already exists, my_file_3 if also my_file_2 already exists and so on).<br>
<br>
It is now possible to configure DaDaBIK to accept all files (regardless to the extensions) coming from upload.<br>
<br>
Since DaDaBIK requires to set magic_quotes_gpc = on in php.ini (which is the default setting), now if magic_quotes_gpc is off DaDaBIK will stop and display an error message.<br>
